# Analyzing-Motorcycle-Parts-Sales-With-SQL
This SQL project analyzes wholesale motorcycle-parts sales across three warehouses. I calculated net revenue by product line using payment-method fees, grouped the results by month and warehouse, and filtered only wholesale orders. The goal was to help leadership understand revenue patterns across product categories and locations.
