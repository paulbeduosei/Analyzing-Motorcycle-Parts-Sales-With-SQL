# Analyzing-Motorcycle-Parts-Sales-With-SQL
Just wrapped up a hands-on SQL project analyzing wholesale revenue for a motorcycle parts company 🏍️📊 The company operates 3 warehouses and sells both retail and wholesale — and I was asked to help leadership understand which product lines drive the most wholesale revenue, and how this changes month-to-month and across warehouses.

I used SQL to calculate net revenue after payment-method fees, grouped results by month and warehouse, and filtered the data to include only Wholesale orders.

It was a super fun challenge — the kind of problem that makes SQL feel like detective work. 🔍

Pull the right fields, calculate net revenue, and suddenly patterns appear that weren’t obvious before.

Love projects like this because they sharpen both my SQL logic and my analytical thinking.
